<p>You know, I really regret taking Music Production class. I&#8217;ve realized throughout the course of 2 school years, that I do extremely poorly on classes that are self directed. Last year, I took Honors Robotics and Engineering. Now, the only reason I took the class was for the free A and honors credit (to boost GPA). I actually enjoyed the class a bit, since it was just basically a 90 minute free period to hanging with my friends. This year, however, I took music production class. My reasons for taking this class are different, it was because I wanted to be able to freely produce music, just like how I write code. I wanted to be able to think of an idea and just create it.</p>



<p>Honestly, I&#8217;m extremely disappointed at how the class is organized. That is &#8211; there&#8217;s pretty much no organization at all, the students in the class can essentially do whatever they want. It&#8217;s almost like there&#8217;s no point for the teacher to even be there for most of the time. It&#8217;s kind of depressing knowing that I&#8217;ve spent every B day 5th period for the past 7 months learning essentially nothing.</p>



<p>It really sucks <img width='16' height='16' class='wp-smiley emoji' draggable='false' alt=':/' src='https://s1.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/uneasy.svg' style='height: 1em; max-height: 1em;' /> I had high expectations for this class. I really wanted to be able to produce computerized songs and EDM beats, but that just doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case. Now, I&#8217;m really tired and bored of music class. Whenever I walk in the classroom, it feels like all of my previous desires to learn and become a musician instantly evaporates, leaving a lifeless corpse that is myself (*ahem* I&#8217;m so bad at writing ahh) (did that even make sense?). I just wanna say that I feel <strong>so unmotivated</strong> to do anything music related now.</p>



<p><strong>Self-directed classes</strong> are stupid. There, I said it. It&#8217;s just really so, so stupid. Putting a group of impulse driven 14/15 year olds in a classroom, and giving them the freedom to do whatever they want to do won&#8217;t go well. What if they don&#8217;t know anything about the subject, and took the class wanting to have a teacher guide them through the subject like literally every other core class?</p>



<p>Like, literally, in the first day of class, the teacher was like okay, if you want to do an independent project, talk to me. Literally 80% of the class wanted to do an independent project, cause as teenagers, we&#8217;re lazy. It&#8217;s B5, the last period of class, what&#8217;s better than spending 90 minutes browsing the internet and looking at memes or texting friends? Unless you&#8217;re one of those rare ones who are mature and independent (not me), you&#8217;re most likely going to feel bored and unmotivated in a self-directed class.</p>
